## 1. Project Overview <a class="anchor" id="1"></a>
This project involves building a recommender system using both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches. The content-based filtering uses TF-IDF vectorization of item descriptions, while the collaborative filtering approach leverages a pickled SVD model for recommendations based on user interactions. The app provides recommendations using both methods to deliver a comprehensive user experience.

**Objectives**
This project involves building a recommender system using both content-based and collaborative filtering approaches. The content-based filtering uses TF-IDF vectorization of item descriptions, while the collaborative filtering approach leverages a pickled SVD model for recommendations based on user interactions. The app provides recommendations using both methods to deliver a comprehensive user experience.leveraging the recommender system to deliver content that matches user preferences.


## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a class="anchor" id="2"></a>
The EDA section involves analyzing the dataset to understand user preferences and item characteristics. Key activities include:

**Data Inspection:** Reviewing the structure and contents of the data.
**Feature Analysis:** Exploring item descriptions and user ratings.
**Visualization:** Creating charts and graphs to visualize user preferences and item popularity. 


## 3. Model Implementation <a class="anchor" id="3"></a>

# Content-Based Filtering
**Approach:** Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to analyze and recommend items based on their content.
**Implementation:** Details on how TF-IDF features are extracted and used for recommendations.
Collaborative Filtering
**Approach:** Employs an SVD model, which is pre-trained and pickled, to provide recommendations based on user-item interactions.
Implementation: Explanation of the SVD model and how it predicts user preferences.

 

## 4. User Interface <a class="anchor" id="4"></a>

The Streamlit app features an intuitive interface with the following pages:

**Home Page:** Introduction and app navigation.
**Recommendations Page:** Allows users to input preferences and receive recommendations from both content-based and collaborative approaches.
**EDA Page:** Displays visualizations and insights from the exploratory data analysis.
**About Page:** Provides information about the team and the project.

## 5. App User Guide<a class="anchor" id="5"></a>

**Run the App:** Execute the Streamlit app using the command streamlit run app.py.
**Explore Recommendations:** Navigate to the "Recommendations Page" to input preferences and view recommendations from both models.
**View EDA Insights:** Check the "EDA Page" for visualizations and data analysis results.
**Learn More:** Visit the "About Page" to learn more about the team and the project.

## 6. Future Enhancements <a class="anchor" id="6"></a>

**Model Improvements:** Incorporate more advanced models and techniques.
**User Feedback Integration:** Implement user feedback mechanisms to refine recommendations.
**Enhanced UI Features:** Add more interactive elements and customization options.
